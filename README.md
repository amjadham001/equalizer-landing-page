## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The determinant in the preference between the div and section:
  Rule of thumb: No heading = probably not a section.

About `address` tag (usage note):

- The `address` element can only be used to represent the contact information for its nearest `article` or `body` element ancestor.
- This element should not contain more information than the contact information, like a publication date (which belongs in a `time` element).

### Continued development

- Add some animations
- Pixel-perfect concept

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - This tool helped me to view and inspect the design in more detail such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`, to get a perfect and consistent result.
